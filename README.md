# ðŸš€ Web3 and Blockchain Basics

This project is my first step into the world of **Blockchain** and **Web3**.  
I explored how decentralized systems empower users through transparency, trust, and true ownership of data and assets.

## ðŸ§  About the Project

Through this task, I learned how to set up a **MetaMask wallet**, connect to the **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**, obtain **testnet ETH**, and interact with a **Uniswap testnet DApp**.  
It gave me hands-on exposure to how transactions, wallets, and smart contracts function in a decentralized ecosystem.
